<h1 id="what-is-an-empathy-map">What is an empathy map?</h1>

<p>People are very malleable and their experiences have major effects on their chances of using a product. In order to account for this, we have to ensure that our research looks into the emotions, goals, motivations, and context of a person to develop the best possible user persona. Furthermore, we also can use an empathy map to ensure that our own biases aren’t controlling the outcome of the application and ruining the user experience for others.</p>
