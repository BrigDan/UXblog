# Evaluation

Because the original proposal stated in the introduction involved an iterative process and this blog only shows one sprint of the process I wanted to provide feedback on what I would do differently in the next sprint of the project.

After finishing my high fidelity prototypes and distributing it to friends in my online communities I collected critiques and criticism from them to account for detail decisions as well as things I would do differently in user interaction.

I further believe that I did well to implement features of other applications within my category such as the volume of the audio to speech slider in the sleep segment of my application which was a feature of the app Headspace.

In this screenshot, I am told about how one of my sleep time-recommendation screens has issues with the font and display and they further go on to tell me that there is no way to set a specific time for wakeups only the recommended ones. This will go into my next iteration and I will improve the layout and content of this page.

In this screenshot, I am showed that the button alignment on some of my elements as well as the icons for my project is not consistent with one another. While this is a minor design flaw it is important to iron these out in high fidelity prototypes to ensure that the user's judgment is fair.

In this screenshot, I am told by one of my testers that the tips shown in my "Tip" section don't meet the quota of what a tip is. This has a disruptive effect on my user experience and I will make sure that either the physical tips give actual advice or the name is altered to also include enlightening quotes.

This tester told me that having a refresh button would be a good idea for my tips section so that the user doesn't have to rely on me to update the screen with tips for them daily putting the user in control, I believe this is an important part of user interaction and I will add it to my next iterations.

All of these considerations will be taken into my empathy maps and I will also be sure to produce a deeper user connection by providing user stories in my next iteration. I will also ask more questions about competing products in my user research to find more features to add.
