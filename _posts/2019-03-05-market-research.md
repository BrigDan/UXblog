This application claims to use multiple features including pink-noise and binaural sound technology. |  + Built in alarm <br><br> + Relaxation during the day and nap support <br><br>  + Tips | Binaural sounds should be considered as another way to create dreamscapes in my application.


# Who is our demographic
The demographic for my product is very broad as the application can be used for more than just sleep aid. However, I will focus on sleep aid being the main purpose which makes the audience for my application younger people who are restless and need external stimuli to unwind and provide escapism.
