# Low fidelity prototype
A low fidelity prototype can be done in a lot of ways but the idea is to keep it as bare as possible in presentation and data shown as its usually not constant.

# My Low fidelity prototype
For my low fidelity prototype I went for something a lot more simple, I decided to graph out a sort of flowchart of user interraction and then turn it later on to be a wireframe. By doing this I already had a good idea of the sort of layout my project was going to contain which not only helped with wireframing but also building the high fidelity prototype.

# What is a wireframe
A wireframe is a schematic of sorts which is used to design the very base skeletal framework of a website, wireframes can serve the purpose of reviewing with users and other stakeholders as well as mapping out the design of your website in reality to point out any potential flaws. Wireframes as the name suggests however are supposed to be kept simple in order to allow for rapid iteration of ideas.

## My wireframe for my product
I decided to do a paper mockup type of a wireframe which features a bit more information than empty boxes, however I did this because I already had a low fidelity chart mapped out and had a good idea of the elements that I wanted in my program. We can also see evidence of iteration in my wireframes and how they change from my chart.
