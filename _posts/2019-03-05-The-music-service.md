# My product idea
The musical service I have decided to create will be a therapeutic application used for the purpose of relaxation, sleep aid and studying. The application will produce natural sounds of the world which includes rain, wind, fire crackling and other natural sounds,

## Unique Features
 The unique selling point of my product is the ability to choose a specific real life location and get pre-recorded and real time sounds from the location. Users can submit their own field recordings and share them amongst each other building a community and producing an endless stream of pleasurable and relaxing sounds. Furthermore, users will also have the ability to listen to sounds from the past and from the future to help immerse themselves into a specific calming environment.
