# What is a high fidelity prototype
A high fidelity prototype is a interactive and often working version of the application not intended for produtction while also maintaining a high detail representation of the final product. Using this prototype we can accurately track user behaviour in the application and see reactions to the visuals and aesthetics of the application we are presenting ad well as to see user flow and behaviour.
