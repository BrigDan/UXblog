# What is the purpose of this blog?
The purpose of this blog is to document the development of a digital music service starting from the base of the iterative design process all the way to the final high-fidelity product.

# What is the iterative design cycle?:
The iterative design cycle is a combination of phases used when producing product ideas and designing the experiences for the product. The iterative design cycle generally follows the cycle of Observing, Ideating, Prototyping and Testing.

## What should I expect from the blog?
The blog posts will document the [music service]({{http:/schooluxblog.brig.space:4000}}{% post_url 2019-03-05-The-music-service %}) idea I have thought of and how its unique features meet the needs of my user group. I will follow the structure of:

* **Market Research**
    *  Analysing existing products and seeing what is unique about them and their targeted demographic and finding out how my application differs from the competiting products.
* **Audience Research**
    * Looking into my particular target audiences and deciding on the specific groups my product will be targeting.
* **User Persona**
    * Creating a persona based on my research and analyzing how they will interact with my product.
* **Empathy Map**
    * Analyzing the specific emotions the persona will encounter during usage of the product and the thoughts and feelings they have that would lead them to using the product.
* **User Persona**
    * Looking at how the user will go about their day and analyzing where the application may be used during their average day.
* **Wireframes**
    * Prototypes of my product in both physical paper form and digital form. I will be using mockups for the digital wireframe.
* **Prototype(High Fidelity)**
    * A more fleshed out digital prototype which will work almost identically to the application.
* **Evidence of user testing & iteration**
    * Reviewing the application with potential users and evaluating the improvments to make during the next iteration of the cycle.
