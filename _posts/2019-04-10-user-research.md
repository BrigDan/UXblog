## Target Audience

To begin creating a user persona I firstly have to understand what kind of user my application is targeting. Because my application indents on aiding people with sleep issues my demographics are very broad.

## Quantitative research
In order to break down my demographics, I will focus potential users based on certain reasons backed by academic studies and statistics relating to variables that will affect the usage of my application:

### Reason 1) Elderly people do not use smartphones
As [58% of elderly aged 65+ do not use smart phones](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/) I will exclude potential elderly people with sleep problems from my demographic. I further believe this won't make the product harder to use for them should the 42% choose to.

### Reason 2) Work-Related stress will impact adult sleep
Because the majority of sleep issues revolve around stress, people in work and academia should be targeted for my application. Sleep is also [important for young people's development](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/teens-and-sleep) so it is critical to ensure that there are resources available to help with insomnia.


### Reason 3) There is a sleeplessness crisis in young adults an teenagers
Data by analysed [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/30/childrens-lack-of-sleep-is-hidden-health-crisis-experts-say?CMP=aff_1432&utm_content=The+Independent&awc=5795_1556143576_d5c3bb3b9a1bbb9630e5ddd61612b958) from the NHS suggests that sleep disorders have been a large problem amongst teenagers, with diagnosis of sleep disorder going up for people 16 and under. Largely, technology is to blame as social media and blue light can interrupt natural sleep patterns and keep us awake longer than we might want.

Moreover, This problem doesn't seem to only affect adolescents. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30515935) in Norway shows that insomnia and sleep-disorders are on the rise amongst college and university students. This is concerning as lack of sleep can make a significant difference to the quality of work produced by the students.

Personally, I believe phones are a tool which can be used for good and bad purposes, which is why producing a sleep aid application that reminds the user that they should have a good nights sleep could be helpful.

My assumptions help me cut down my demographic by age to people between 15 and 30.

## Audience Segmentation
In order to further break down demographics into something more homogeneous I categorised the normal and niche users within my age range.

Based on a questionnaire(_Figure 1.1_) I've had with 25 users, I have an idea of the average user of my product.

(_Figure 1.1_)
##### Control Variables and Sample Size
While my sample size is relatively low, I tried to ensure that the spread of users were more oriented for quality of answers rather than quantity. For my control variable, I tried to get users who I knew had good sleep habits.

#### Behavioural
In order to get an idea of behaviours for my user demographic. I asked the users that were filling out my survey of their behaviours before bed. This will help me get a better understanding of how many people would use my application to fulfil their needs before bed.

Out of 25 people, 20 responded saying a variety of things. (As shown in _Figure 1.2_.) I begun to understand is that their current before-bed practices could be substituted by my application. 1/2 of the responses were related to listening to music, which could be replaced with the various sound-recreation features my app provides. One of the responses told me that some users use earplugs, which could be replaced with white noise.

Furthermore, the remaining responses while not being directly helpful (such as "Not drinking coffee") could be incorporated into my applications advice system and be shown to users as they go throughout their day.

The majority of the responses (52%) said that they would use the app to help themselves sleep which gives me confidence that my application could have some traffic.
    
#### Psychographic
In order to get a better idea of the sort of lifestyles my potential users live, I asked questions regarding their time spent working or studying a week. As well, I asked about their time spent meditating and using their phone in order to test how likely the user would have access to my application,how many users could see the potential benefit of the guided meditation and what the amount of stress these individuals are under from work.

##### Mobile phone use
The results (_Figure 1.3_) show that the majority of people use their phone 3-6 hours a day with people who always use their phone coming in by a small margin. These statistics show that I would have the most success designing my application for this demographic.

(_Figure 1.3_)

##### Meditation
I found out from my research that the majority of users did not meditate, with only a small percentage saying they do. However, I am not hesitating with adding guided meditations into my features as the minority that said they did meditate outweighed those who don't.

(_Figure 1.4_)


##### Workload
As for workload (_Figure 1.5_), none of the people said they didn't work, with the vast majority working 20-40 hours. The amount of work seems to have affected the sleep of users as when asked what kind of things kept them up at night I got responses such as "Work Stress" and "Insomnia, homework, stress" with someone saying "I have a very messy workflow in general, and that makes me end up not going to bed in a decent time, or in a better regulated system."

![Workload](/assets/img/questionnairework.png)
(_Figure 1.5_)

From this research I would expect my user to want a service that can help them forget about their work and focus on getting a good nights sleep, which can be done through various mindfulness and sleep meditation techniques as well as relaxing music. Furthermore by suggesting ways to make their day less stressful I can help make sure that they become less fatigued by their work.

#### Demographic
As stated in my previous research into groups that use smartphones, the demographic I'm aiming for is young adults and teenagers between the age of 15 and 30.

As for gender, The Norwegian study mentioned beforehand shows that more women than men were having issues with insomnia and sleep disturbances by 10%. However, because sleep disturbances are on the rise for both genders my applications should be created for both men and women.

In order to understand the amount that my applications should be priced at I asked my potential users, as shown in _Figure 1.6_.

![Pricing](/assets/img/questionnaireprice.png)
(_Figure 1.6_)

This gives me a good idea of the expected pricing from my users. I will definitely consider making the application free and provide a subscription service for extra features. However, I have to be mindful for the pricing as it seems to have a major effect on the likelyhood of my user subscribing. (_Figure 1.7_)

#### Geographic
To begin with I would like to deploy my application amongst university campuses and colleges to see their effect as that is the place with the most people fitting my demographic. 

#### Occasional
This program will be used when people need a good nights sleep or need to take a break to relax or meditate.
