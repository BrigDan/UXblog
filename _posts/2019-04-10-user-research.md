## Target Audience

To begin creating a user persona I firstly have to understand what kind of user my application is targeting. Because my application indents on aiding people with sleep issues my demographics are very broad.

## Quantitative research
In order to break down my demographics, I will focus potential users based on certain assumptions backed by academic studies and statistics relating to variables that will affect the usage of my application:


### Assumption 1) Elderly people do not use smartphones
As [58% of elderly aged 65+ do not use smart phones](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/) I will exclude potential elderly people with sleep problems from my demographic. I further believe this won't make the product harder to use for them should the 42% choose to.

### Assumption 2) Work-Related stress will impact adult sleep
Because the majority of sleep issues revolve around stress, people in work and academia should be targeted for my application. Sleep is also [important for young people's development](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/teens-and-sleep) so it is critical to ensure that there are resources available to help with insomnia.

My assumptions help me cut down my demographic by age to people between 15 and 25.

## Audience Segmentation
In order to further break down demographics into something more homogeneous I categorised the normal and niche users within my age range.

Based on a questionnaire(_Figure 1.1_) I've had with 20 users, I have an idea of the average user of my product.

##### Control Variables and Sample Size
While my sample size is relatively low, I tried to ensure that the spread of users were more oriented for quality of answers rather than quantity. For my control variable, I tried to get users who I knew had good sleep habits.

#### Behavioural
In order to get an idea of behaviours for my user demographic. I asked the users that were filling out my survey of their behaviours before bed. This will help me get a better understanding of how many people would use my application to fulfil their needs before bed.

Out of 25 people, 20 responded saying a variety of things. (As shown in _Figure 1.2_.) I begun to understand is that their current before-bed practices could be substituted by my application. 1/2 of the responses were related to listening to music, which could be replaced with the various sound-recreation features my app provides. One of the responses told me that some users use earplugs, which could be replaced with white noise.

Furthermore, the remaining responses while not being directly helpful (such as "Not drinking coffee") could be incorporated into my applications advice system and be shown to users as they go throughout their day.

The majority of the responses (52%) said that they would use the app to help themselves sleep which gives me confidence that my application could have some traffic.
    
#### Psychographic
    Considers the lifestyles, interests (needs/wants) and aspirations of consumers. This may relate to perceptions of quality and the image the consumer wants to portray of themselves, or relate to what or who inspires them
#### Demographic
    This is the highest and most basic level in which you can segment the audience and relates to age, gender, income, educational level. Demographic segmentation can often remain quite broad so may require further division
#### Geographic
    This subset considers where your audience is, are they local, national or international. How might audiences in rural areas differ from urban areas?
#### Occasional
    This type of segmentation is independent of the consumer and focuses more on the occasion that the product serves. For example orange juice is typically bought for the occasion of “breakfast time” and is often marketed for that occasions and ignores other demographic segments.  Christmas products are another example of occasional segmentation.
